K-Means Statistical Test Results:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with specific number of clusters have no affect, i.e. they all have the same Silhouette score.
Alternative-Hypothesis: They all have different Silhouette score.
Results: t-stat = 776.272, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.


Silhouette means:
2 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.281
3 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.322
4 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.275
5 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.258
6 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.253
7 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.239
8 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.243
9 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.235
10 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.235


The optimal number of clusters is: 3, with t-stat of: 23.853, and p-value of: 0.000.
