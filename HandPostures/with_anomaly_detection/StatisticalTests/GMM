GMM Statistical Test Results:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with specific number of clusters have no affect, i.e. they all have the same Silhouette score.
Alternative-Hypothesis: They all have different Silhouette score.
Results: t-stat = 1631.161, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.


Silhouette means:
2 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.052
3 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.070
4 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.053
5 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.065
6 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.012
7 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.00
8 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.01
9 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.021
10 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.018


The optimal number of clusters is: 3, with t-stat of: 13.097, and p-value of: 0.000.
