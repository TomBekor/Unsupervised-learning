Spectral Statistical Test Results:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with specific number of clusters have no affect, i.e. they all have the same Silhouette score.
Alternative-Hypothesis: They all have different Silhouette score.
Results: t-stat = 449.661, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.


Silhouette means:
2 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.131
3 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.078
4 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.01
5 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.05
6 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.06
7 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.005
8 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.007
9 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.04
10 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.02


The optimal number of clusters is: 2, with t-stat of: 50.499, and p-value of: 0.000.
