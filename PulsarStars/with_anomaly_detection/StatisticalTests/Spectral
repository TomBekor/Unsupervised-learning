Spectral Statistical Test Results:

The optimal number of clusters is: 3, with t-stat of: 3.941, and p-value of: 0.000.

Testing history:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with 2 clusters have the same Silhouette score as clustering with 3 clusters.
Alternative-Hypothesis: clustering with 2 clusters have greater Silhouette score than clustering with 3 clusters.
Results: t-stat = -3.941, p-value = 1.000.
Failed to reject the Null-Hypothesis.



Null-Hypothesis: clustering with 3 clusters have the same Silhouette score as clustering with 4 clusters.
Alternative-Hypothesis: clustering with 3 clusters have greater Silhouette score than clustering with 4 clusters.
Results: t-stat = 16.928, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.
