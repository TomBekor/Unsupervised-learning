Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Statistical Test Results:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with specific number of clusters have no affect, i.e. they all have the same Silhouette score.
Alternative-Hypothesis: They all have different Silhouette score.
Results: t-stat = 3088.690, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.


Silhouette means:
2 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.332
3 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.343
4 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.196
5 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.199
6 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.193
7 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.160
8 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.166
9 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.142
10 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.136


The optimal number of clusters is: 3, with t-stat of: 3.659, and p-value of: 0.000.
