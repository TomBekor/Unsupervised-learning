GMM Statistical Test Results:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with specific number of clusters have no affect, i.e. they all have the same Silhouette score.
Alternative-Hypothesis: They all have different Silhouette score.
Results: t-stat = 969.058, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.


Silhouette means:
2 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.040
3 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.050
4 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.035
5 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.01
6 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.050
7 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.00
8 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.034
9 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.026
10 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.00


The optimal number of clusters are: 3, 6
