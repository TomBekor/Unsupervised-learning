Testing history:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with 2 clusters have the same Silhouette score as clustering with 3 clusters.
Alternative-Hypothesis: clustering with 2 clusters have greater Silhouette score than clustering with 3 clusters.
Results: t-stat = 180.960, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.
