GMM Statistical Test Results:

The optimal number of clusters are: 3, 6

Testing history:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with 2 clusters have the same Silhouette score as clustering with 3 clusters.
Alternative-Hypothesis: clustering with 2 clusters have greater Silhouette score than clustering with 3 clusters.
Results: t-stat = -7.298, p-value = 1.000.
Failed to reject the Null-Hypothesis.



Null-Hypothesis: clustering with 3 clusters have the same Silhouette score as clustering with 4 clusters.
Alternative-Hypothesis: clustering with 3 clusters have greater Silhouette score than clustering with 4 clusters.
Results: t-stat = 12.357, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.



Null-Hypothesis: clustering with 3 clusters have the same Silhouette score as clustering with 5 clusters.
Alternative-Hypothesis: clustering with 3 clusters have greater Silhouette score than clustering with 5 clusters.
Results: t-stat = 53.974, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.
