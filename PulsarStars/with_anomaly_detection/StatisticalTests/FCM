FCM Statistical Test Results:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with specific number of clusters have no affect, i.e. they all have the same Silhouette score.
Alternative-Hypothesis: They all have different Silhouette score.
Results: t-stat = 1349.351, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.


Silhouette means:
2 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.282
3 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.284
4 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.240
5 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.238
6 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.221
7 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.192
8 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.199
9 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.183
10 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.192


The optimal number of clusters are: 2, 3
