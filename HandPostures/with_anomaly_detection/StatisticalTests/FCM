FCM Statistical Test Results:

Null-Hypothesis: clustering with specific number of clusters have no affect, i.e. they all have the same Silhouette score.
Alternative-Hypothesis: They all have different Silhouette score.
Results: t-stat = 64.345, p-value = 0.000.
The Null-Hypothesis rejected and it proves that the Alternative-Hypothesis is correct and statistically significant.


Silhouette means:
2 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.164
3 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.086
4 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.069
5 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.059
6 clusters Silhouette Score: 0.034
7 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.00
8 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.09
9 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.09
10 clusters Silhouette Score: -0.07


The optimal number of clusters is: 2, with t-stat of: 28.732, and p-value of: 0.000.
